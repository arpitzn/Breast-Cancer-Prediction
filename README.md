# Breast-cancer-prediction
Prediction of Breast cancer using Logistic regression.
We have a dataset which have 10 attributes, by using these attributes we predicted that the tumor is malignant or benign using Logistic Regression and then by the category of tumor we predicted that a perticular having the breast cancer or not.
We predicted this with an accuracy of 96.70% and Standard deviation of 1.97%
So our accuracy is varies between 94.73% (96.70 - 1.97) to 98.67% (96.70 + 1.97)

I took this dataset from :- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29
